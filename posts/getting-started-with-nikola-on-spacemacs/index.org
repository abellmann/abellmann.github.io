Today I started my blogging journey with the [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]] static blog engine. Here is
my experience so far.

I found this blog engine by following [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8&list=PL9KxKa8NpFxIcNQa9js7dQQIHc81b0-Xg][Mike Zamansky's Youtube channel]] on Emacs,
where he published an emacs tutorial on [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-35-blogging/#.WamW6Y4z2qA][blogging]] with Nikola (using emacs orgmode
as markup language). 

Since I have been using Spacemacs now for a while and have always been looking
for an easy way to use orgmode to write a blog, this just seemed like the
perfect way to get started.

Installing Nikola and deploying it on github was a breeze. I just had to follow
the very simple [[https://getnikola.com/getting-started.html][installation guide]] for Nikola(for MacOs in my case). I also
added the [[https://plugins.getnikola.com/v7/orgmode/][orgmode plugin]]. 

To generate a blog post I am using yasnippet based on the sample provided by
Mike and created a snippet, that looks something like this (in
~/.emacs.d/snippets/org-mode/post)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: a new blog post
# key: post

[[http://jr0cket.co.uk/2016/07/spacemacs-adding-your-own-yasnippets.html][Here]] is a guide on using yasnippet in spacemacs. And [[https://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/snippet-development.html][here]] is the documentation
on writing yasnippets.

I also added prodigy to spacemacs. This can be done by adding the "python" and
"prodigy" layers to spacemacs. 

The configuration of the prodigy service for nikola can then be done in the
user-config section of .spacemacs as follows

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
   (prodigy-define-service
     :name "nikola"
     :command "nikola"
     :args '("auto")
     :cwd "~/projects/abellmann.github.io"
     :tags '(blog nikola)
     :stop-signal 'sigint
     :kill-process-buffer-on-stop t
     )
#+END_EXAMPLE

To run the nikola service in spacemacs, the correct python virtual environment
must be active. This can be done by calling =M-x pyenv-activate= and then
selecting the venv directory prepared for nikola or by activation python-mode,
followed by =SPC m V a=

The nikola service can be run with =SPC a S= and then =s= on the
"nikola" service to start the server. You can then open [[http:localhost:8000]] in
your browser and the browser page gets refreshed with the new content every time
you save your file, which makes checking the result pretty easy.

To stop the nikola server, just hit =S= on the nikola service.
